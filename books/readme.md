Directory to store code based on the reading of books.

The current plan is to read and write code base on the following books:  
1. Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. [Introduction to algorithms](https://www.amazon.de/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262533057). MIT, 2009  
2. Straustrup. [The C++ programming language, 4th edition](https://www.amazon.de/C-Programming-Language-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0321563840). Adisson-Wesley, 2013  
2. Skiena. [The algorithm design manual, 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.de/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693). Springer, 2009
